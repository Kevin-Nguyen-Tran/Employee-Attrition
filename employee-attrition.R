# keep in mind, these good predictors are determined by their relationship to one another towards attrition
# It is interesting to see that Numbers of Companies Worked and Years Since Last Promotion is statistically significant and a good predictor of attrition when it showed no average difference (noted by the t.test and heat map) in earlier sections
