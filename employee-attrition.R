# hourly rate, percent salary hike, years since last promotion, and gender all show no significant difference in those who did and did not leave their job.
# Surprisingly, Distance from Home and Work Life Balance showed a statistically significant positive and negative difference between those who did and did not leave their jobs, respectively.
# according to the heat map, the distance from home had a 0.08 correlation and Work Life Balance had a -0.06 correlation.
# Therefore, we can reduce our window to +- 0.05 for the neutral window from +-0.1. This will accurately group our variables.

# 5. NEGATIVE CORRELATION TO ATTRITION
#=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================
# Negative corr: job satisfaction, age, total working years, years in current role, years at company, years with current manager, and environment sat
# We will explore the negative correlation, which shows that as this variable increases, the likelihood of attrition will decrease!
# these are the variables that retain employees as it progresses!
